Practicing_With_Test_Cases
Advanced Java Topics

    You will be creating some original programs that have Unit Testing included. These will be added to the class organization 
        repo.
    You will be required to create one for each type of structure:
    -Simple output
    -If
    -If/else
    -if/elseif (else is optional on this one)
    -While
    -for
    -1D array
    -2D array
    -ArrayList
    
This practice primarily taught me how to make basic test cases, similar to Hacker Rank, but much more crude.

# TestCases
/**ArrayListQuestion
     * You are given an the task of creating a program that simulates a storage room
     * You must be able to add and delete items from the program at will.
     * <p>
     * hint: The input is an array so you will have to convert to an arraylist
     * <p>
     * you will be expected to create an arrayList that will add someItem at index thisIndex
     * while also being  expected to remove an item from the index otherIndex;
     * <p>
     * Example: {a, b, c, d, f, f}, "e", 4, 6
     * <p>
     * The arrayList: a, b, c, d, e, f
     */
     
/**ArayQuestion
     *You are a student who is tasked with sorting the grades of the class
     * the scores range from 0-100, your task is to arrange it in a new array that
     * sorts the scores from lowest to highest.
     * Ex
     * {0, 10, 100, 12, 50}
     *
     * Output: {100, 50, 12, 10, 0}
     */
         
/**Else_If_and_If
    *You have been hired to create a discount organizer for a local movie theater
    * If person is younger than 9 return "child", if younger than 18 return "student", if under 65 give "regular"
    * and if 65 or greater give "senior".*/
         
        
/**for_Question  
    * You have been learning about fractals, you decided to create a very simple fractal out of these little "*"
    * the fractal consists of creating multiple layers of "*" while each lower level is one less than the one before it
    *
    * Create a starTriangle based on the value of someNum
    * example: if someNum = 4
    * there should be a new line after each row, even if it is the last * in the program;
    *
    * output: ******
    *         *****
    *         ****
    *         ***
    *         **
    *         *
    */
/**If_Else_Question
    *You have been asked to find all the zero's in a list of assignments,
    * if the grade is equal to zero return true to let the teacher know, otherwise right no
    *
    */
/**If_Question
    *You are a student in Mrs Rioux's class, here is your assignment:
    *
    * if someNum is greater than 5 return true, otherwise return false**/
         
/**Q2DArray
    *You are a navy radar opperator tasked with finding the location of a ship
    * in a coordinate plane. The plane is represented by a 2D array where a 0 is empty water
    * and a 1 represents a ship. Your job is to return the coordinate of the ship from the 2D array by
    * returning a string of row number + collum number
    * if there is no ship return -1
    *
    * Ex:
    * 000000
    * 000100
    * 000000
    * 000000
    *
    * return: "1 3"
    */
     
/**SimpleOutput
    *YOu are greeted in the hallway, it would be rude not to say Hello**/
     
/**While Question
        *With the launch of the new FalconX rocket you are more excited than ever
         * YOu decide the best way to wait for the next launch is to create a coutdown using a while loop
         * because why not.**/
